## Deep Overview

Baymax is built using Django, a robust Python web framework. The main interface (`baymax.html`) provides a clean and modern UI for users to interact with the AI agent. The backend leverages Django views and models to process data and deliver insights. Static assets and templates are organized for easy customization.

### How It Works
1. **User Interaction:** Users access Baymax via a web browser and upload or select data for analysis.
2. **AI Processing:** The backend processes the data, applies AI models, and generates insights.
3. **Visualization:** Results are displayed in a user-friendly format, with options for further exploration.

### Customization
You can extend Baymax by adding new Django apps, integrating additional AI models, or connecting to external data sources.
